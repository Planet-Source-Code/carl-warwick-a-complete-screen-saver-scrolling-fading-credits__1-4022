You are free to alter this program or use it in your own programs as long as I'm given credit for it.

This program demonstrates how to create a screen saver in Visual Basic, it also shows how to make scrolling credits that fade in and out of the screen.

The Fading, Scrolling credits:-
 Useful for end credits for a game etc.
 Easy to adapt for you own programs.
 Only one label and one timer are required at design time.

Creating your own Screen Saver:-
 In the module you'll find the code used to make the screen saver, without this code your screen saver will just run straight away without you even selecting it.
 It also shows you how to use a settings screen, and saves these settings to control.ini in windows which is where the information for all screen savers is saved.

 Once you have made your screen saver make it into an exe file.
 Change the file extension to .scr
 Right click it and click install
 and there you have it, your very own screen saver...
